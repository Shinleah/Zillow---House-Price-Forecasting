This project aims to make a prediction of housing location based on housing price, room number, and date built.
Data on about 11,000 homes sold in a single year are extracted from Zillow for 50 campus towns in the U.S. (https://www.zillow.com). 
The House_Prices data represent a highly simplified/modified sample of anonymized homes, excluding homes with observations that seem erroneous and/or not pertaining to sales.
